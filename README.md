# fadi-noor - HangMan-Game

Hangman is an old paper and pencil guessing game for two or more players. One player thinks of a word, phrase or sentence and the other(s) tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses.

Though the origins of the game are unknown, a variant is mentioned in a book of children's games assembled by Alice Gomme in 1894 called Birds, Beasts, and Fishes. In France the game is drawn with a man on a guillotine and the rest is drawn, minus a head.

We decided to select this a as our project for the first week, and built a webpagage that simulates the game,actually can be played and either you win or lose!
